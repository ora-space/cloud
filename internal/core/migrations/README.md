# Database Migrations Module

This module contains Ora Cloud's linear, forward-only PostgreSQL schema migration catalog. Migrations are embedded directly into the Go application binary using `embed.FS` and applied deterministically by `cloudctl migrate`.

## Migration catalog

Migrations are executed in ascending numerical sequence:

- **`0001_core.sql`**: Foundational domain schema:
  - Identity & Access: `users`, `user_identities`, `tenants`, `tenant_memberships`, `credential_refs`.
  - Projects & Workspaces: `projects`, `project_storage`, `workspaces`, `workspace_worktrees`, `tasks`.
  - Execution runtime: `sandbox_instances`, `workspace_nodes`, `sessions`.
  - Control plane: `effects`, `operations`, `tickets`, `controller_leases`, `idempotency_keys`.
  - Invariants: Partial unique index `one_main` ensures at most one active `main` workspace per project. Foreign keys strictly enforce tenant and owner containment across all hierarchy tiers.
- **`0002_aggregate_guards.sql`**: Concurrency and mutual exclusion guards:
  - Prevents concurrent lifecycle mutations on the same project aggregate.
  - Ensures soft-deleted ancestors prevent active child state transitions.
- **`0003_resource_versions.sql`**: Optimistic concurrency controls:
  - Enforces `version` incrementing rules across mutable entities (`projects`, `workspaces`, `tasks`, `nodes`, `operations`).
  - Guards against lost updates in concurrent API operations.
- **`0004_effect_intent_and_ticket_scope.sql`**: Execution intent and ticket constraints:
  - Enforces strict scoping of execution tickets to active workspace nodes and valid admission epochs.
  - Binds durable effect declarations to specific operation phases.

## Checksum integrity and immutability

- **`schema_migrations` table**: Tracks applied versions, their SHA256 checksums, and application timestamps (`version`, `checksum`, `applied_at`).
- **Server startup check**: At startup, `cmd/server` runs `store.CheckSchema`, verifying that:
  1. All embedded `.sql` migration files exist in `schema_migrations`.
  2. The SHA256 checksum of each embedded file matches the recorded checksum in the database.
  3. No unknown or extraneous migration versions exist in the database.
  If any mismatch or unapplied migration is found, the server terminates immediately.
- **No AutoMigrate**: The production server daemon **never** executes DDL or modifies table structures at startup. Migrations must be applied using `cloudctl migrate` under dedicated database administrator credentials.
